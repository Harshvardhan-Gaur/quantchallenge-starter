# QuantChallenge Results

## Feature Insights
- Features are **stationary** and **co-integrated**.
- Correlation mapping:
  - **Y1** ~ C, E, G, H, J, M, N  
  - **Y2** ~ A, B, D, F, I, K, L  

## Model Performance
- **LightGBM**, **XGBoost** (with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning), and **KNN**  
  - Achieved **R² ≈ 0.69 – 0.70**  

## Advanced Models
- **Cross-validation** with deep models:
  - Transformer-based model for **Y1**
  - CNN-based model for **Y2**
- Performance: **R² ≈ 0.78**

⚡ We were not able to submit the later results due to time taken by the model to run was too long and thus we missed the deadline by 2-3 mins. Thank you.
